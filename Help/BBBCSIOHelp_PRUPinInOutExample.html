<h2>About the PRU Pin Input/Output Mechanism</h2>
<P>
There are two ways a PRU program can read or write to the pins on the Beaglebone Black's P8 and P9 header. The first method is to enable 
the OCP master port and then manipulate the pins via the GPIO subsystem. In other words, the PRU accesses addresses in the main Beaglebone
Blacks memory and can read or write the bits which are related to the GPIO OCP device. This is exactly the way the Linux GPIO device driver
operates and also the method used in other examples in this series such as the <a href="BBBCSIOHelp_PRUBlinkUSR3LEDExample.html">PRU Blink USR3 LED Example</a>.
<P>
The second method of reading or writing to the pins on the Beaglebone Black's P8 and P9 header is to use the PRUs own internal registers 
(rather than the Beaglebone Blacks main memory space) for the purpose of reading or writing to the inputs or outputs. This is considerably
faster (by about a factor of 10 or 20). However there is a drawback in that the pins involved are split among, and dedicated to, a specific PRU. In other words,
if you write some PRU code to directly read
or write to its I/O pins then that code must necessarily be specific to either PRU0 or PRU1. 
Fortunately there are quite a number of 
<a href="http://www.ofitselfso.com/BeagleNotes/BeagleboneBlackPRUInputPinMuxModes.pdf" title="Beaglebone Black PRU Input PinMux Modes">input</A>
pins and <a href="http://www.ofitselfso.com/BeagleNotes/BeagleboneBlackPRUOutputPinMuxModes.pdf" title="Beaglebone Black PRU Output PinMux Modes">output</a> 
pins per PRU. Also note that the some of the pins cannot be configured both an input and an output like the GPIO's
can. The pins the PRU accesses are hard coded to the PRU and are also often restricted to being either an input or and output. 
<P>
The upshot is that the PRU direct input and outputs are much faster but are somewhat restricted in number, are specific to the PRU and are often
not bi-directional. The GPIO I/O method is more versatile, slower, but is able to reference pins that cannot be accessed from either PRU. A discussion
of the PinMux and how it controls access to the I/O lines on the P8 and P9 Header can be found on 
<a href="http://www.ofitselfso.com/BeagleNotes/BeagleboneBlackPinMuxModes.php" title="Beaglebone Black Pin Mux Modes">this page</a> and a discussion on how to 
configure the PRU I/O pins can be found 
<a href="http://www.ofitselfso.com/BeagleNotes/UsingDeviceTreesToConfigurePRUIOPins.php" title="Using Device Trees To Configure PRU I/O Pins">here</a>.
<P>
This sample code will illustrate how to use the R31 and R30 registers of PRU0 to read the high/low state of an input and to set the state of an output 
to match that input. For the purposes of demonstration, the off/on state of the USR3 LED will also be set to follow the state of the input. The
setting of the USR3 LED state is via the slower GPIO mechanism. There is no direct PRU output (on either PRU) which can adjust the state 
of the USR3 LED. As mentioned previously, not all I/O is available via direct PRU access. 
<P>
The example below shows how to use the <a href="BBBCSIOHelp_PRUDriver.html">PRU_Driver</a> class of the 
<a href="http://www.OfItselfSo.com/BBBCSIO/BBBCSIO.php#Download" title="BBBCSIO Library">BBBCSIO</a> library to load the PRU binary (compiled PASM Assembler). 
For the purposes of illustration, the example binary being loaded and run is hard coded in the sample source and you will need to 
modify the path prior to executing it yourself.
<P>
<P>
NOTE: The PRU code the example below will run is called <code>PRUPinInOut.bin</code> and the PASM Assembly Language source for this code can be found in the file
<a href="BBBCSIOHelp_PRUPinInOutExamplePASMCode.html">BBBCSIOHelp_PRUPinInOutExamplePASMCode.html</a>. You should probably read the comments in the <code>PRUPinInOut.p</code>
source file in order to understand the operation of this program.

The code below illustrates how to use the launch, and interact with, a compiled PRU binary 
using the <a href="BBBCSIOHelp_PRUDriver.html">PRU_Driver</a> class of the

            pruDriver.PRUStop();
 
            // close the driver
            pruDriver.Dispose();

The <code>PRUPinInOut</code> call would be made via a line which looks like:

   PRUPinInOut(PRUEnum.PRU_0);
