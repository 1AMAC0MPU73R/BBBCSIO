<h2>About the Serial Port Class</h2>
<P>
The Serial Port class writes to and reads from the one of the six UART On Chip Peripheral (OCP) devices integrated into the Beaglebone Black CPU (although only four of those devices are usable). In the Linux operating system there are two ways of accessing the UART OCP devices; the first, called TTY, is the 
standard and approved Linux technique. TTY is a device driver and if the existence of a serial port is detected during boot time,
the device driver interface will be exposed as a file in the <code>/dev</code> directory of the Beaglebone Black file system. The
serial ports will only be detected if that port is appropriately configured in the Device Tree. 
<P>
The second type of access is called Memory Mapped access and this treats the Beaglebone Black's RAM memory as if it were a file. The UART is manipulated as if
it were a bit at an offset in a virtual file. The BBBCSIO library does not, at this time, provide a class which utilizes Memory Mapped access
to a serial port - the file system based TTY class named <a href="BBBCSIOHelp_SerialPortFS.html">SerialPortFS</a> is the only one available.
<P>
There are four usable serial ports on a Beaglebone Black. If these ports have been correctly configured in the Device Tree, the TTY device driver for that port will be accessible via a file in the <code>/dev</code> directory. This file will have names in the format <code>ttyO&lt;Serial Port&gt;</code> where <code>&lt;Serial Port&gt</code> is the number of the serial port. Thus the file <code>/dev/ttyO0</code> is the interface for the TTY device driver on serial port 0. If you do not see the <code>ttyO*</code> file in the <code>/dev</code> directory this means that the serial device is not correctly configured in the Device Tree. By the way, these files are the sort of files you can open and read and write text from (like you can do with the SYSFS GPIO subsystem) in order to read and write data to the serial port. A command like ... 
<pre>
cat /dev/tty04
</pre> 
... will continuously output all received data from the port. However reading and writing in this way is not too useful as you cannot easily set any of the serial port parameters (baudrate, parity etc.). In practice, the ttyO files best treated as true device files and if you want them to do anything 
you have to use an <code>ioctl()</code> call.
<P>
<h2>Warnings - READ THIS!!!</h2>
<P>
The pins (including the serial port pins) on the Beaglebone Black are 3.3Volt. You CANNOT connect them up to a 5V serial device without level shifting the voltage or you will burn out the BBB. You DEFINITELY CANNOT connect them to the +/- 18V of a true RS232 serial port (on the back of a PC) because your BBB will instantly die.
<P>
The serial port used in the examples below is ttyO4 - this must be configured in the Device Tree in order for it to be available for use. Typically this is done using a pre-prepared standard Device Tree Overlay. 
For more information on this see the <a href="http://www.ofitselfso.com/BeagleNotes/Beaglebone_Black_And_Device_Tree_Overlays.php">Beaglebone Black and Device Tree Overlays</a> 
Technical Note.  
<P>             
The <a href="http://www.ofitselfso.com/Beagle/InstallingArmhfKernelBeagleboneBlack.php">armhf Linux</a> running on the Beaglebone Black is <font color="red">not a real-time operating system</font>. However, an OCP peripheral such as the serial port has its own internal clock and so, once the information is given to the port, it will be transmitted and received at the configured port speed with no interruptions. However, transfers made via multiple calls to the serial port can, and will, have variable gaps between transmissions as the process is pre-emptively swapped in and out by the kernel.

<h2>An Example of the Serial Port Usage</h2>
<P>
The code below illustrates how to use the SerialPortFS class to read and write from a serial device (serial port 4 in this case). See the comments in the code below for a simple method to use the UART1 to test out the connection mechanism.

        /// Then a single character and a CRLF combination will be transmitted.

In the above code, the <code>serialID</code> is passed in when the function was called. This value is a member of the 
<code><a href="BBBCSIOHelp_SerialPortEnum.html">SerialPortEnum class</a></code> which lists all possible serial ports which
can be present on the Beaglebone Black. The above code is called via a line which looks like:
<pre>
SerialPortFSTest(SerialPortEnum.UART_4);
