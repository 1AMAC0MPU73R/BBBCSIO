<h2>About Read and Write PRU Inputs and Output PASM Code</h2>
<P>
The <a href="http://www.ofitselfso.com/BeagleNotes/BeagleboneBlackPRUInputPinMuxModes.pdf" title="Beaglebone Black PRU Input PinMux Modes">inputs</A> and 
<a href="http://www.ofitselfso.com/BeagleNotes/BeagleboneBlackPRUOutputPinMuxModes.pdf" title="Beaglebone Black PRU Output PinMux Modes">outputs</A> available to each PRU are specific to the PRU. Consequently the code below is designed to work 
only in PRU0 of the Beaglebone Black and is intended to be launched by 
the <a href="BBBCSIOHelp_PRUDataInOutExample.html">PRUDataInOut</a> example C# code. The comments
in the code below and the discussion on the <a href="BBBCSIOHelp_PRUDataInOutExample.html">PRU Data In Out</a> example
page describe the usage, operation and output of this code. You will also probably need to configure the PinMux to route the
P8_16 and P8_11 I/O lines to the PRU for input and output (respectively). If you are not very familiar with the operation of the
PinMux you should review the <a href="http://www.ofitselfso.com/BeagleNotes/UsingDeviceTreesToConfigurePRUIOPins.php" title="Using Device Trees To ConfigurePRU I/O Pins">Beaglebone Black PinMux Modes</a> and 
<a href="http://www.ofitselfso.com/BeagleNotes/BeagleboneBlackPinMuxModes.php" title="Beaglebone Black Pin Mux Modes">Using Device Trees To Configure PRU IO Pins</a> documents in order
to increase your understanding of the operation of this code. Example Device Tree Overlays which can be used to configure the appropriate
PinMux settings can be found on the

///  PRUPinInOut.p  - a PASM assembly language program, intended to run in
///                   the Beaglebone Black PRU0 and which will monitor an input
///                   for a high or low state and will set an output and the
///                   USR3 LED to reflect that state. R31 bit 14 is used as an 
///                   input. This corresponds to header 8 pin 16. R30 bit 15
///                   is used as the output and this corresponds to header 8 pin 11.
///
///                   If H8_16 goes high, R31 bit 14 will go high. This will cause 
///                   the the USR3 LED will be turned on and R30 bit 15
///                   to also be set high. Similarly when R31.t14 goes low then
///                   the USR3 and R30.t15 will go low. Thus the USR3 LED and the 
///                   output on pin H8_11 will follow the high/low input state of 
///                   the pin on header 8 pin 16. 
///
///                   The choice of header 8 pin 16 as an input and header 8 pin
///                   11 as an output is somewhat arbitrary. Note that not every 
///                   header pin has a corresponding mapping to a bit in the PRU 
///                   R31 (output) and R31 (input) registers and the pins that do
///                   have such mappings are specific either to PRU0 or PRU1 and
///                   also can only ever be inputs or outputs but not both. You will
///                   see such pins named like: pr1_pru0_pru_r31_14. The "pru0" means
///                   it is only available in PRU0, the "r31" means it is an input only
///                   ("r30" would be used if it was an output). The "14" means it is 
///                   mapped to bit 14 in R31. You have to look in the various 
///                   documentation to find out that pr1_pru0_pru_r31_14
///                   will actually be accessible on Header 8 pin 16 if the PinMux
///                   mode for offset 0x038 is set to pinmux mode 6.
///                   
///                   Setting the correct pinmux mode is not as hard as it seems. The mode
///                   is not set in the code below (although it could possibly be done by 
///                   fiddling with the bits in the PinMux OCP device). The mux settings 
///                   were done by creating and compiling an overlay. The links below

// this is the address of the BBB GPIO Bank1 Register. We set bits in special locations in offsets
// here to put a GPIO high or low. It so happens that the BBB USR LED3 is tied to the 24th bit.
// Note GPIO's still have to be enabled in the PINMUX if you want to see the signal on the 
// BBB P8 and P9 Headers. The USR LED3 is usually mux'ed in by default so it is a good one to
// use as an example.

#define GPIO1_LED3BIT 1&lt;&lt;24

// at this offset various GPIOs are associated with a bit position. Writing a 32 bit value to 
// this offset enables them (sets them high) if there is a 1 in a corresponding bit. A zero 
// in a bit position here is ignored - it does NOT turn the associated GPIO off.
#define GPIO_SETDATAOUT 0x194

// you may think that you turn off (set low) a GPIO by writing a 0 somewhere. After all, you set it
// high with a 1 so why not set it low with a 0. That is NOT the way it works. 
// We set a GPIO low by writing to this offset. In the 32 bit value we write, if a bit is 1 the 
// GPIO goes low. If a bit is 0 it is ignored. Thus we can write the same value (GPIO1_LED3BIT 
// in this example) to two different registers in order to turn it on and then off again.
#define GPIO_CLEARDATAOUT 0x190

        // of extra trouble. This is because below 0x0008_0000 you are hitting the
