<h2>About the PRU Interrupt To Host Mechanism</h2>
<P>
The Beaglebone Black PRU's can send interrupt style events to user mode host programs. This event manifests itself by the presence of 
4 readable data bytes on one of the <code>/dev/uio[0:7]</code> files. If the event has not been sent then any code which attempts to read
from that file will simply block (wait) until an interrupt is sent. The number of the UIO file (0 to 7) is representative of the number of the interrupt
which has been sent. However, the interrupt number the PRU activates and the UIO file on which the event occurs is not strictly fixed. The UIO file on which
any particular PRU event can appear can be set via configuration options in the PRU's Interrupt controller.
<P>
The BBBCSIO <a href="BBBCSIOHelp_PRUDriver.html">PRU_Driver</a> class is designed to be able to transmit such PRU Interrupts to a C# program via a 
.NET event to which that program is a subscriber. In order to present a consistent interface, the PRU_Driver has a <i>&quot;Standard&quot;</i> mapping of PRU
interrupts to UIO file output. This mapping is completely arbitrary (and, it must be said, probably unique to the BBBCSIO library) but has been structured
to provide a certain logical operation. 
<P>
The PRU_Driver class <a href="http://www.ofitselfso.com/BBBCSIO/Source/PRUDriver.cs.html">source code</A>
contains numerous lengthy comments regarding the <i>&quot;Standard&quot;</i> mapping, but the general idea
 is that if you write a 0 to bits [0-3] of Register 31 (R31) in the PRU you will get an event out on the
file <code>/dev/uio0</code> and this corresponds to the <code>PRUEventEnum.PRU_EVENT_0</code>. If you write a value of 1 to R31 bits [0-3] you get an event out on the
file <code>/dev/uio1</code> and this corresponds to the <code>PRUEventEnum.PRU_EVENT_1</code>. Thus, there is a simple mapping, a 6 in the PRU is <code>PRU_EVENT_6</code> in the BBBCSIO 
PRU_Driver code - and so on. 
<P>
Of course you still have to trap the PRU events in your C# program and this can be done synchronously (the program blocks until the event happens) and
asynchronously (the program does other things and the interrupt appears as a C# event). The example code below shows you how to set both of these up.
<P>
NOTE: Since we are interacting with the PRU we also have to run code on the PRU and this code is necessarily specific to the example. The PRU PASM assembly language code for the example 
below can be found in the file <a href="BBBCSIOHelp_PRUInterruptHostExamplePASMCode.html">BBBCSIOHelp_PRUInterruptHostExamplePASMCode.html</a> 
<P>
<h2>Warnings - READ THIS!!!</h2>
<P>
Always be aware that the armhf Linux running on the Beaglebone Black is <font color="red">not a real-time operating system</font>. This means, 
for example, that although the PRU's are real time by the time the event gets down to the user space program for processing 
the process may have been pre-emptively swapped in and out many times by the kernel. The timing of the interrupt events you will receive
in the C# code is absolutely not real time or deterministic. 
<P>
<h2>An Example of the how a Host C# program can trap PRU Interrupt Events</h2>
<P>
The code below illustrates how to use the functions in the PRU_Driver class to launch a <a href="BBBCSIOHelp_PRUInterruptHostExamplePASMCode.html">PRU program</A> and interact with the 
events it sends. The comments in the example describe the operation of the code. Note that two of the events
will trigger the <a href="#PRUEvent_OnInterrupt">PRUEvent_OnInterrupt</A> event handler the example code for which is located at the bottom of this page.

            // we still have to clear it

            Console.WriteLine(", PRU Program has terminated");

            // disable the event monitoring
            pruDriver.PRUEventMonitorOff(PRUEventEnum.PRU_EVENT_1);
            pruDriver.PRUEventMonitorOff(PRUEventEnum.PRU_EVENT_2);

            // close the driver, the code in the PRU remains running
            pruDriver.Dispose();
        }   
</pre> 

The <code>PRUEventMonitorOn()</code> statements in the above code subscribe to the PRU_Driver class OnInterrupt event and any events triggered 
by the PRU will appear in the named <code>PRUEvent_OnInterrupt</code> handler. Example code for the <code>PRUEvent_OnInterrupt</code> handler is given below. You can
route more than one PRUInterruptHost to the same handler - however to do anything useful you will need to 
use the information passed in during the event to figure out which event was triggered.
<P>
Note that the code below <font color="red">executes in a different thread</font> than the one in which the PRUInterruptHost function was
created. You should not do any lengthy processing in the interrupt handler thread as no other interrupts can be processed
until the current interrupt is cleared.
