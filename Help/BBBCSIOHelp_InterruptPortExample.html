<h2>About the InterruptPort classes</h2>
<P>
The InterruptPortMM class is designed to send an .NET event to a subscriber when the state (high or low) of a GPIO pin on the Beaglebone Black changes. 
The BBBCSIO library usually provides classes for both SYSFS and Memory Mapped access however the InterruptPort functionality is only available in 
MemoryMapped mode.
<P>
The GPIO on which the InterruptPortMM class operates must be configured as an input in exactly the same way as if it were to be used with any of 
the InputPort classes. 
<P>
<h2>Warnings - READ THIS!!!</h2>
<P>
The example code below uses a GPIO value of 49 which is exposed as pin 23 on the P9 header. You <b>CAN NOT</b> assume that this pin is available as a GPIO 
on your Beaglebone Black and even if it is a GPIO you still cannot assume it is set as a GPIO input (as opposed to being an output). Any one GPIO can be used for any of about 
half a dozen different peripherals
(UART, SPI bus, PWM, A/D, HDMI, EMMC etc) and it is <font color="red">not a given</font> that a GPIO used in these examples or any specific GPIO is available. The GPIO's
used in these examples may be used for other things on your Beaglebone Black.
<P>
Before using an InterruptPort class on a GPIO you will need to ensure that the GPIO is configured as an input. There is no code you can call 
in the BBBCSIO library which does this. You <font color="red">MUST configure the GPIO externally</font> prior to running your executable - 
usually this is done by <a href="http://www.OfItselfSo.com/BeagleNotes/BeagleBoneBlack_DeviceTreeConfig_GPIO.php">editing the device tree</a>.  
<P>
Always be aware that the armhf Linux running on the Beaglebone Black is <font color="red">not a real-time operating system</font>. This means, 
for example, although you might set up an InterruptPort() object to watch for pin state changes it is possible some changes may be missed
as the process is pre-emptively swapped in and out by the kernel.
<P>
<h2>An Example of the InterruptPort Usage</h2>
<P>
The code below illustrates how to use the InterruptPortMM class to monitor the state of a GPIO pin and send an event to a remote method (which can
be in an entirely different class). The example interrupt handler simply outputs a summary of the event to the console.

        ///   This code assumes that the port associated with the gpioID has been

        ///   then the interrupt may not work correctly. See the associated documentation

        /// &lt;history&gt;
        ///    28 Aug 14  Cynic - Originally written
        /// &lt;/history&gt;
        public void SimpleInterruptPortMM(GpioEnum gpioIn, InterruptMode eventInterruptModeIn)
        {
            if (gpioIn == GpioEnum.GPIO_NONE)
            {
                throw new Exception ("Bad interrupt port GpioEnum.GPIO_NONE");
            }

            // create an interrupt port.
            InterruptPortMM ipPortGPIO = new InterruptPortMM(gpioIn, eventInterruptModeIn);
            // Hook up an event handler to the OnInterrupt event 
            // the IpPortGPIO_OnInterrupt function will receive the incoming event data
            ipPortGPIO.OnInterrupt += new InterruptEventHandlerMM(IpPortGPIO_OnInterrupt);
            // we will not get any data if it is not enabled
            ipPortGPIO.EnableInterrupt();
            // run until we get key press on the console
            while (Console.KeyAvailable == false)
            {
                // sleep for a second
                Thread.Sleep(1000);
            }
            // this just stops all transmissions. The interrupt can be enabled again
            // NOTE: disabling the interrupt does not release the event resources
            ipPortGPIO.DisableInterrupt();
            // close the port
            ipPortGPIO.ClosePort();
            // usually a good idea to dispose()
            ipPortGPIO.Dispose();
            // we never can use this object again after it is disposed. To use it
            // again we would have to re-create it
            ipPortGPIO = null;
        }
</pre> 

The above code subscribes to the InterruptPort's OnInterrupt event and any events will appear in the named
<code>IpPortGPIO_OnInterrupt</code> handler. Example code for the <code>IpPortGPIO_OnInterrupt</code> handler is given below. You can
route more than one InterruptPort to the same handler - however to do anything useful you will need to 
use the information passed in during the event to figure out which event was triggered.
<P>
Note that the code below <font color="red">executes in a different thread</font> than the one in which the InterruptPortMM was
created. You should not do any lengthy processing in the interrupt handler thread as no other interrupts can be processed
until the current interrupt is cleared.

In the <code>SimpleInterruptPortMM</code> call, the <code>gpioID</code> and <code>eventInterruptModeIn</code> are passed in when the function was called. 
These values are members of the 
<code><a href="BBBCSIOHelp_GPIOEnum.html">GpioEnum</a></code> and <code><a href="BBBCSIOHelp_InterruptMode.html">InterruptMode</a></code> enumerations.
The called would be made via a line which looks like:
<pre>
SimpleInterruptPortMM(GpioEnum.GPIO_49, InterruptMode.InterruptEdgeBoth);
