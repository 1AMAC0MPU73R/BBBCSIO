<h2>About Host and PRU Data Exchange PASM Code</h2>
<P>
The code below is designed to work in either PRU of the Beaglebone Black and is intended to interact with 
the <a href="BBBCSIOHelp_PRUDataInOutExample.html">PRUDataInOut</a> example C# code. The comments
in the code below and the discussion on the <a href="BBBCSIOHelp_PRUDataInOutExample.html">PRU Data In Out</a> example
page describe the usage, operation and output of this code.

///  PRUDataInOut.p - a PASM assembly language program, intended to run in
///                   the Beaglebone Black PRU and which will accept an
///                   integer, double it, and then return it. It implements
///                   a simple semaphore system to coordinate actions with
///                   the user space program. 
///
///                   This code is intended to demonstrate the use of
///                   the PRU data RAM as a means of passing data
///                   between the PRU and a user space program and so
///                   this is probably not the most optimal or practical 
///                   bit of PASM assembly code you will ever see.
///
///                   Compile with the command
///                      pasm -b PRUDataInOut.p
/// 
///                   This code was written as part of the BBBCSIO library
///                   which is designed to provide C#/Mono access to the 
///                   OCP Devices and PRU on a Beaglebone Black. Since this
///                   code is in PASM assembler, it is not really related to
///                   C#/Mono and you could compile and then run it 
///                   using any language which can load a binary into the 
///                   Beaglebone Black PRU.
